\section{CSC299 - Fall 2015 - Lab Assignment 3}

\subsection*{IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS}

\noindent Use this URL to verify your progress:
\begin{verbatim}
https://mdp.cdm.depaul.edu/csc299
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Login into:
\begin{verbatim}
mdp.cdm.depaul.edu
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Under your csc299 folder create a new folder called {\tt lab03} and, under the latter, create a new file called {\tt README.json}. This file should contain:

\begin{verbatim}
{"student_id": "<yourstudentid>", "name": "<yourname>", "email": "<youremail>"}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent After completing each task below remember to do:

\begin{verbatim}
git add README.json
git add *.txt
git add *.csv 
git add *.py
git commit -a -m "task completed"
git push
\end{verbatim}

\noindent  else I will not receive your work.

\noindent ATTENTION: Files are different for each student.

\subsection{Task 1 (2 points)}

\noindent  Create a new folder {\tt ~/csc299/lab03} and {\tt cd} under that folder.

\noindent  Create a program called {\tt program31.py} which downloads the files
\begin{verbatim}
http://mdp.cdm.depaul.edu/csc299/static/data/<yourid>.accounts.csv
http://mdp.cdm.depaul.edu/csc299/static/data/<yourid>.expenses.csv
\end{verbatim}

\noindent  and saves them in {\tt accounts.csv} and {\tt expenses.csv} respectively.

\subsection{Task 2 (3 points)}

Create a program called {\tt program32.py} which reads {\tt accounts.csv} and outputs the total of column 4 (BEGIN\_BALANCE) to a file called {\tt balance.txt}.

\subsection{Task 3 (3 points)}

\noindent Create a program called	{\tt program33.py} which reads {\tt expenses.csv} and outputs the	total of column 2 (EXPENSE) to a file called {\tt totals.csv}. The format of this file should look like:
\begin{verbatim}
USER_ID, TOTAL_EXPENSE
0000001,$45.00
0000002,$67.00
0000003,$29.00
...
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Where \$45 would be the sum of all expenses of USER\_ID 000002, etc. Actual numbers may vary.

\subsection{Task 4 (3 points)}

\noindent  Create a program called	{\tt program34.py} which reads {\tt accounts.csv} and {\tt expenses.csv} and outputs to a file called {\tt results.csv} the following columns:
\begin{verbatim}
USER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, BEGIN_BALANCE, END_BALANCE
000001,Brook,Apple,$556868.00,$556606.00
000002,Judie,Giff,$441474.00,$441150.00
000003,Fred,Khalili,$518865.00,$518523.00
...
\end{verbatim}

\noindent where the first 4 columns are the same as {\tt accounts.csv} and the last column is compute using the formula:

\begin{verbatim}
END_BALANCE = BEGIN_BALANCE - TOTAL_EXPENSE
\end{verbatim}

\noindent {\tt TOTAL\_EXPENSE} is the value computed at task 3.

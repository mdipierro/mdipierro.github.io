1) For each of the following numbers compute exponent and mantissa and provide the binary representation for both exponent and mantissa (ignore sign of mantissa). For each state whether it is periodic or not:

1.625
0.1625
3330

2) Compute the Taylor expansion around 0 of each of the following functions, prove convergence, and implement the expansion in python code (ans show your steps):

f(x) = sin(x)*cos(x)
f(x) = exp(-x*x)

3) For which of the following functions determine the range of values where the condition number is less than 1.

f(x) = (x-3)^2
f(x) = (sin(x)-3)^(-1)
f(x) = 1/(1+exp(x))

4) Consider the following matrix:

[[1, a, 0], [a, 2, 0], [0, 0, 3]]

For which values of a is it positive definite?
For which values of a is it negative definite?

5) The nlib library does not have an algorithm for the determinant of a matrix. Add it to the class Matrix using a non-recursive algorithm. It must work as

import nlib
a = Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
print a.det()

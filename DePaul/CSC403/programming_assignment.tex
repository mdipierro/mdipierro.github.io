{\LARGE CSC403 Programming Assignment}

Write a java program that reads from the input a list of floating point numbers (one per line) and stores them in a binary search tree. Then the program computes:

\begin{itemize}
\item The sum of all the numbers. (2 points)
\item The sum of the squares of the numbers (2 points)
\item The number of links to travel from the smallest number to the largest number (4 points)
\item The maximum distance between two nodes in the tree (4 points).
\end{itemize}
The output should also be in the form of 4 numbers, one per line.

Your code should be indented and the input/output of each function should be documented within /* comments */. Smaller code is better than longer code. Submit a single file called ``CSC403A1.java'' (not zipped).

## CSC478 - Winter 2018 - Assignment 1 - Due Jan 26

Download the file assignment1.csv

The file contains 1000 rows, 5 features, and a boolean column y. 
Some features may be invalid (not a number, too large, too small). This is intentional.
Your goal is to predict y using different techniques.

Write an iPython notebook that performs the following operation:
- plots the distribution of each column and look for outliers
- for each feature column compute mean and standard deviation
- for each couple of features compute the correlation and make a table of correlations
- answer question: is correalation large or small?
- answer question: does small correlation imply they are independent?
- remove all rows that have invalid numbers and/or impute missing numbers
- normalize each column to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1
- split the dataset in two parts [:n] for training and [n:] for testing (n = 50%)
- run KNeighborsRegressor fit/predict
- provide the following output in tabular format:
  % predicted correctly
  % of true positives
  % of true negatives
  % of false positives
  % of false nagatives
  % f1 score
- compute the same results using LogisticRegression
- compute the same results using LogisticRegression without removing the outliers.
- Answer question: are results better after removing outliers? why?

Important:

All your files should be named "{student_id}-{student-name}-{assignment-number}".
Upload them using D2L. Zip together your notebook along with the notebook converted to PDF

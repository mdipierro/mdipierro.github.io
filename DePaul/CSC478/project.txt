CSC478 Final Project, Winter 2018

Consider the dataset in 

    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset

In particular extract hours.csv from the zip file.

Consider exclusively the following columns: [season, yr, mnth, hr, workingday, weathersit, atemp, hum, windspeed, cnt].

Compute the following:

- a plot of cnt by hour for the average working day
- a plot of cnt by hour for the average non-working day
- a plot of cnt by hour for the average rainy day
- a plot of cnt by hour for the average non-rainy day
- remove outliers (if any) and discuss your process for determining outliers (if any)
- build a pipeline that includes an imputer and a standard scaler
- predict the cnt using linear regression
- discuss which parameters influence the prediciton the most
- predict whether it is a raining day (weathersit) or not from the non weather columns
- predict whether it is a working day or not from the other columns
- for each prediction above, use the appropriate metric and discuss your result
- use all columns but the weather columns, apply the standard scaler, and run the kmeans algorithm (with k=2) to divide the points in two groups. How well do your two clusters overlap with rainy/non-rainy days? What metric would you use to determine that? Discuss your results

Deliver your result in the form of a PDF document with text and inline plots. 
Place code and tables in the appendix.
